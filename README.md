### Weekly Item Template
Each week, a new ticket will be created to track work being done and questions arising. A new comment will be created for each work day within that ticket. Once a week's completed, the ticket will be moved into Done. This is less tied to completion and more to what is being done each day.

Issues will be numbered with any relevant information nested beneath.

#### Questions/Issue:
